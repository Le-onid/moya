<p class="para">I've fled my hometown, changed my number and stolen a 2017 Ford Fiesta, but nothing seems to be working. I uninstalled the Duolingo app 5 days ago, but I still get the notifications demanding me to learn Spanish. On the third day, I heard a window downstairs break and found a brick on the floor. There was a note tied to it saying,”Your time is almost up. Learn the fucking mexican words or else”. I don’t have the work ethic to dedicate the effort to learn the language, and just accepted my fate. But the next day, when I found the brakes in my car removed after causing a minor accident at a nearby intersection, I realized that I’m afraid to die. In that very moment, I received another notification saying,“It’s too late for practice now. Speak the Spanish all you want, I will make sure of tu muerte”. I then turned around to see what I swear was a mass of neon green feathers dart behind a tree. I did not sleep that night, and I’m thankful for it. A few hours after I went to bed, the owl appeared in my window, but quickly fled after I drew my firearm from my nightstand. That’s when I decided it was time to leave, and later stole a car parked down my street. But I know that my fate is sealed. Because every second I’m not running, he’s only getting closer. The notifications from the deleted duolingo app have been getting progressively darker and more sinister. The last one didn’t even ask me to practice learning my language. It was just the owl asserting to me that he is God. I know I’ll die soon. I’ve accepted it. Yet I’m still upset that my life has to end because of my inability to learn Spanish.</p>
